This assignment specification   may   be   updated to   reflect clarifications and   modifications   after   it   is first   issued.
You   are   required to submit   a single report in the form. of   a   single PDF file with a file-name that includes your University u-number ID.    The first   page   must   have a clearly   identified title and   author, with   both   name and   university   u-number, which   may form. a   separate   cover   page. You   may also attach supporting   information   as   appendices   in the   same   PDF   file. Appendices will   not   be   marked.
This   is a single-person assignment and   must   be   completed   on   your   own.   You   must   use quality   reference   material   and carefully   reference via   in-text citations,   including   material provided to you   in the course. Any   material that you   quote   must   have   the   source   clearly referenced.   It   is   unacceptable to   present   any   portion   of another author's work as your   own.   Anyone found doing so will   be   penalised   in   marks.   In addition, ANU   plagiarism   procedures apply. This course   introduces fundamental concepts that could   potentially   be   addressed   by certain Generative AI tools   (e.g., ChatGPT).   Hence, the use of any Generative AI tools is not permitted in graded assessments within this course. 
You are strongly encouraged to start   working   on   the   assignment   right   away.   You   can   submit   as   many times as you wish. Only the   last submission   at   the   due   date   will   be   assessed.
Task 
The Australian Computer Society Code of Professional Conduct 2014 is expected to   be applied   by all   Computing   Professionals   in Australia.    It   sets   out six   values   but   stresses   the primacy of the   public   interest   as the overriding value.   In 2018, the   Australian   Government Office of the Australian   Information   Commissioner   released the Guide to Data Analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles (APP).   In   2022   UNESCO   published the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (SHS/BIO/PI/2021/1) for voluntary application   by   Member   States. The   recommendation   is   broad   in scope and far-reaching   in   implementation responsibilities over the whole AI system   lifecycle.   It   includes   a   statement   of values   and   10 principles that should   be   respected   by all actors   in the   AI   lifecycle,   including “ data scientists, end-users, business enterprises, universities and public and private entities”   (p10). These three   documents   must   be   read   and   are   provided with this assignment specification
You   must also   read the   paper,   Clarke   R.   (2018),    “Guidelines for the Responsible Application of Data Analytics” Computer   Law  Security   Review 34, 3   (Jul-Aug   2018), that   is   provided   with this assignment specification   and   hereafter   referred to as the Guidelines. You   must   also   read the   paper,   Du,   Liu and   Hu,   (2020) “ Techniques for Interpretable Machine Learning”, 
Communications of the ACM   63(1) that   is also   provided with the   assignment specification.
You   are to   consider the application of the ACS code of   conduct,   the   10   UNESCO   Principles,   Clarke’s   Guidelines   and   Duetal’s   Techniques   to   the   following   fictitious ad targeting scenario. You   may also   use the APP guide, where   it   is   helpful.
Ad Targeting Scenario (from   Clarke   R.   (2016) “Big Data, Big Risks”,   Information   Systems   Journal   26,   1 (January   2016) 77-90,   PrePrint   athttp://www.rogerclarke.com/EC/BDBR.html 
A social media service-provider accumulates avast amount of social transaction data, and some economic transaction data, through activity on its own sites and those of strategic partners. It applies complex data analytics techniques to this data to infer attributes of individual digital personae. It projects third-party ads and its own promotional materials based on the inferred attributes of online identities and the characteristics of the material being projected. 
The 'brute force' nature of the data consolidation and analysis means that no account is taken of the incidence of partial identities, conflatedidentities, obfuscated identities, and imaginary,fanciful, falsified and fraudulent profiles. This results in mis-placement of a significant proportion of ads, to the detriment mostly of advertisers, but to some extent also of individual consumers. It is challenging to conduct audits of ad-targeting effectiveness, and hence advertisers remain unaware of the low quality of the data and of the inferences.

You   must answer the following questions, clearly   indicating which   question you   are answering within your submission. The   page   lengths suggested for   each question   here   are   for guidance only; the given   page   length   limit for the overall   assignment   is   mandatory. 
Question 1.    (1 page) Consider the ACS   code   of   conduct.   For   each   of the   six values,   taking   account of any   relevant   sub-parts, discuss whether the value   was   demonstrated   in the scenario   and to what extent.   If you assess any   value   as   largely   irrelevant   to   the   scenario,   then   a very   brief   reason for this assessment   is sufficient. 
Question 2. (1/2 page) Consider the   10   UNESCO   Principles   [S   III.2].   Looking closely at Principle Proportionality and Do No Harm [p20],   discuss   how   this   principle   is   applied   (or   not)   in the scenario and   identify any   potential   harm that   might   have   ensued. 
Question 3.    (2 pages) Consider the   numbered   guidelines   in Table   2   of   Clarke’s Guidelines for the responsible application of data analytics. From   every   segment   (1   General,   2   Data Acquisition, 3   Data analysis, and 4   Use of the   Inferences)   choose   one   guideline   that   you consider would have been applied in the scenario.   Its   application   may   not   be   explicit   in the   scenario description,   but   it   should   be   relevant   and   important to the scenario   and you   can argue that   it was applied   properly and therefore did   not   contribute to   the   negative consequences of the scenario. Explain its   role   in the scenario   including   how   it would   have contributed to   positive outcomes. Justify why   it   is more relevant than   everyone of the other   guidelines that you consider would   have   been   applied   in   the same   segment. Argue how   it is more or less relevant than any guidelines   in the   same   segment that   you   consider   may   have been disregarded   in the scenario.    Be   careful to   consider the   intention   of   the   guidelines rather than an overly   literal   interpretation; you   may   rephrase the   chosen guideline for   the   scenario context where   beneficial.   For further explanation of   this   point,   see   Section   3   in Clarke’s Guidelines.
Question 4. (1 page) (a) Choose one,   numbered guideline   (e.g. guideline 3.3)   in Table   2   of the Guidelines that you consider to   have   been disregarded   in the   scenario.   You   may   choose   any guideline that you did not choose for   Question   3.      Discuss   how   the   failure   to   consider the guideline   could   have contributed to the   negative outcome of the   scenario. (b) In addition,   identify any other   potential consequences that could have   occurred   due to   the failure to consider that same guideline.   For this   purpose, the   consequences you   identify   are   not   necessarily explicit within the scenario   description.    You   might find   it   helpful to   think   of this activity as contributing to a   risk   assessment   process   prior   to   your   hypothetical   involvement   in the   analysis work of the scenario. 
Question 5. (1 page) Consider   the   paper   by   Duetal, Techniques for Interpretable Machine Learning. Discuss whether   and   how   intrinsic and   post-hoc   interpretability techniques   could   be applied to the scenario and   what   benefits   could   ensue.
General Comments 
An   abstract or executive summary   is   not   required.    A cover   sheet   is   optional   and   does   not   contribute to the   page count.   No   particular   layout   is specified,   but you should   follow   a professional style. and   use   no smaller than   11   point typeface   and stay   within   the   maximum      specified   page   count.    Page   margins,   heading sizes,   paragraph   breaks   and so forth   are   not    specified   but a   professional style   must   be   maintained. Text   beyond the   page   limit   or word         count   limit will   be treated as   non-existent. Appendices   maybe   used and   do   not   contribute      to the   page count,   but appendices   might   be only quickly   scanned   or   used   for   reference   and   will   not   be specifically   marked. 
You   must   properly attribute the source documents provided for your assignment (but   not   this assignment specification   itself)   and any other   reference   materials   you   choose to   use.
You   are   not   required to   use additional   materials. No particular referencing style is required. However, you are expected to   reference conventionally,   conveniently, and consistently. Your   references should   be sufficient to   unambiguously   identify the source, to      describe the   nature of the source, and   also to   retrieve the   source   in   online   and   (if   possible)   traditional   publisher formats. An   assessment   rubric   is   provided. The   rubric will   be   used to   mark your assignment. You are advised to use it to supplement your understanding of what is expected for the assignment and to direct your effort towards the most rewarding parts of the work. 
Your assignment submission will   be treated   confidentially,   but   it will   be available   to   ANU   staff   involved   in the course for the   purposes of   marking.
